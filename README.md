## The application has the following services:

1. Eureka Server
2. Authorization Service
3. Pensioner Detail Service
4. Pension Disbursement Service
5. Process Process Service
6. **Pension Management Portal** (Front-end in Angular)

## 1. Eureka Server
The Eureka Server is responsible for registering all the microservices together so that they can communicate with each other with the help of their application names instead of their IP address which may be dynamic in nature.

## 2. Authorization Service
This service is responsible to provide login access to the application and provide security to it with the help of stateless authentication using JWT Tokens.

### This service provides two controller END-POINTS:
1. Open your spring boot application and run the service.
2. Open your browser and head to this URL - http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html#/ this will redirect you to Swagger UI where you can test the service.
3. Select the authorization controller header
4. **Login functionality**
	1. Select **login** POST method and click try it out
	2. Then enter these **correct** username and password credentials as follows:
      ```
      { 
        username: "admin1", 
        password: "adminpass@1234"
      }
      ```
	3. Then hit execute and you will see a JWT Token generated. Copy this token to be used in the next step.
	4. For these **incorrect** credentials:     
	  ```
    { 
        username: "admin123", 
        password: "adminpass@1234"
    }
    ``` 
    you would receive a message of `Incorrect username or password`

5. **Validation functionality**
	1. Select **validation** POST method and click try it out
	2. Then enter previously generated **valid** Token that you had copied into the Authorization header.
	3. Then hit execute and you would see `true` in the response body.
	4. If the token in **invalid** the application throws an appropriate error response related to either `Token expired`, `Token malformed` or `Token signature incorrect`.
